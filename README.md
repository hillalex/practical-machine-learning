# Practical Machine Learning
Course project for Coursera's Practical Machine Learning course

Project writeup: https://hillalex.github.io/practical-machine-learning/project.html

The data used in this project is the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset from Velloso, E.; Bulling, A.; Gellersen, H.; Ugulino, W.; Fuks, H. Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises, in Proceedings of 4th International Conference in Cooperation with SIGCHI (Augmented Human '13) Stuttgart, Germany: ACM SIGCHI, 2013.

The data comprise measurements from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 users performing barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways, coded as "A" to "E" in the data. This project trains a model in R to predict the manner in which the activity was carried out.
